## Optimistic concurrency control
- Optimistic concurrency in Elasticsearch is like a trust-based system. When multiple users try to modify the same data at once, Elasticsearch assumes everything will go smoothly. It lets everyone make their changes, but when it's time to save, Elasticsearch checks if there were any conflicts. If there were, it figures out how to resolve them, often by looking at timestamps or version numbers, ensuring data integrity without stopping everyone from working.

1. **Example**:
   - **Step 1: Retrieve Document**: Retrieve document with its sequence number and primary term.
   - **Step 2: Make Changes**: Make changes to the document.
   - **Step 3: Check Sequence Number and Primary Term**: Check sequence number and primary term again.
   - **Step 4: Update Document with Sequence Number and Primary Term**:
     ```json
     PUT /my_index/_doc/1?if_seq_no=1&if_primary_term=1
     {
       "field": "updated_value"
     }
     ```
   - **Step 5: Handle Conflicts**:
     Elasticsearch automatically handles conflicts by returning a 409 Conflict status code if the document has been updated by another process since you retrieved it. You can then handle this situation in your application logic.
