## Data Types

Elasticsearch supports various data types, each designed for specific types of data and use cases. Below are the commonly used data types in Elasticsearch:

### Data Types and Use Cases:
Certainly! Here are combined sentences for each data type:

1. **Text**: Used for full-text search and indexing of large blocks of text data, ideal for indexing textual content such as descriptions or articles.

2. **Keyword**: Stores exact values for structured data, suitable for fields that require exact matching and aggregation like IDs or categories.

3. **Numeric Types**:
   - **Integer**: Stores whole numbers without decimal points, commonly used for counting or indexing.
   - **Float**: Stores numbers with decimal points, suitable for storing precise numerical values like prices or measurements.
   - **Long**: Similar to integer but with a larger range, often used for large numerical values.
   - **Double**: Similar to float but with a larger precision, suitable for scientific calculations or financial data.

4. **Date**: Specifically designed for handling date and time values, supporting various formats and time zones, ideal for indexing temporal data such as timestamps or event dates.

5. **Boolean**: Represents boolean values, allowing true/false indexing and filtering, suitable for fields indicating binary states like status or availability.

6. **Binary**: Used for storing binary data such as images or files, enabling the storage and retrieval of non-textual content.

  "text_field": "This is a sample text field.",    // Text data type
  "keyword_field": "category1",                    // Keyword data type
  "integer_field": 42,                             // Integer data type
  "float_field": 3.14,                             // Float data type
  "long_field": 9876543210,                        // Long data type
  "double_field": 1234.5678,                       // Double data type
  "date_field": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",            // Date data type
  "boolean_field": true,                           // Boolean data type
  "binary_field": "VGhpcyBpcyBhIHNhbXBsZSBiaW5hcnk=" // Binary data type (base64 encoded)
}
