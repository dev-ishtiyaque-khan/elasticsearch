1. **Elasticsearch**: 
   - A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and real-time search. 
   - Use cases: Full-text search, log analytics, application performance monitoring, real-time analytics, and security analytics.

2. **Logstash**: 
   - A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite "stash" for storage or further processing.
   - Use cases: Log collection, parsing, transformation, and enrichment from various sources like logs, metrics, web applications, and databases.

3. **Kibana**: 
   - An open-source data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster.
   - Use cases: Data visualization, log and event analysis, monitoring, and exploration of Elasticsearch indices.

4. **Beats**: 
   - Lightweight data shippers that capture and send various types of operational data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
   - Use cases: Collecting logs, metrics, and other data from systems and services like servers, network devices, and cloud platforms.

5. **Elastic Agent**:
   - A unified agent for collecting data from logs, metrics, and endpoint security data. It combines the functionalities of Beats, Logstash, and additional features like centralized management and policy enforcement.
   - Use cases: Log and metric collection, endpoint security monitoring, and centralized agent management.

6. **X-Pack**:
   - X-Pack was an extension of the Elastic Stack, providing additional features and functionalities for security, monitoring, alerting, and reporting.
   - However, as of version 6.3 of the Elastic Stack, X-Pack functionality has been integrated directly into the default distribution, meaning you no longer need to install it separately.
   - Here are some of the key features that were part of X-Pack:
     1. **Security**: Role-based access control, encryption, authentication, and authorization features to secure your Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana.

     2. **Monitoring**: Monitoring capabilities to track the health, performance, and usage of your Elasticsearch cluster and individual nodes.

     3. **Alerting**: Built-in alerting mechanisms to trigger notifications based on predefined conditions and thresholds.

     4. **Reporting**: Generate and schedule reports based on data in Elasticsearch, allowing for automated reporting and analysis.

     5. **Machine Learning**: Advanced machine learning features for anomaly detection, forecasting, and behavioral analysis of your data.

     6. **Graph**: Graph exploration and visualization capabilities to uncover relationships and connections within your data.
