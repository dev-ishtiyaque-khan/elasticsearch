## Elastic Common Schema (ECS)
- ECS, or the Elastic Common Schema, is a standardized data model introduced by Elastic to facilitate consistency and interoperability across various Elastic products and solutions.
- It defines a common set of field names and data types for describing log and metric data, making it easier to analyze and visualize data from different sources within the Elastic Stack.
- By adhering to ECS, users can simplify data integration, correlation, and visualization workflows, enabling more efficient and effective data analysis and monitoring.
